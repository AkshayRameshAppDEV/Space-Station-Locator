# Space-Station-Locator
The International Space Station travels about 30000 kilometers per hour, which is really fast. This is an Alexa skill, which will give you the current location of the space station. If you are lucky, it will tell you the country where the current location of space station is or it will tell you the latitude and longitude coordinates.
